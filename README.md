# Core Native WII

This project is a basic micro-gameengine to run lua in the **Nintendo WII** and **GameCube** _(comming soon)_,
which can be expanded to a custom engine, such as [Gly Engine](https://github.com/gamelly/gly-engine) or [Love2d](https://github.com/gamelly/love-engine).

| :warning: Attention |
| :------------------ |
| **Wiimotes are not working!** I'm not sure whyâ€”although the code appears to be correct, there's likely some missing configuration or refinement needed in the [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/gamelly/core-native-wii/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) file to ensure proper connection. |
